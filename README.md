# ♻️ Multi-Drone Waste Collection Simulation 🚁

A simulation where multiple drones collect waste in a grid, avoid obstacles, and return to dock for charging — with smart pathfinding and battery logic.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🤖 Two smart drones
- 🧠 BFS pathfinding (avoids obstacles)
- 🔋 Returns to dock on low battery/full capacity
- 📦 Collects waste types: Plastic, Organic, Metal
- 🔊 Speaks updates (using `pyttsx3`)
- 📉 Visual simulation with `matplotlib`

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pyttsx3
Step 2: Run the simulation
